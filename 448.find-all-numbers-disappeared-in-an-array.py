#
# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some
# elements appear twice and others appear once.
# 
# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
# 
# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the
# returned list does not count as extra space.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
# 
# Output:
# [5,6]

        nums.append(0)
        res = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while nums[nums[i]] != nums[i]:
                nums[nums[i]],nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i and i != 0:
                res.append(i)
        return res
